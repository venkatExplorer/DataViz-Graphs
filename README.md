Data Visualization Project

Overview
This project showcases various data visualization techniques using Python. The goal is to explore different types of graphs to understand trends, distributions, and relationships within data.

Graphs Included

1. Area Chart - Displays cumulative trends over time.
2. Bar Plot - Compares categorical data.
3. Box Plot - Highlights outliers and data distribution.
4. Doughnut Chart - A variation of a pie chart for proportions.
5. Histogram - Shows frequency distributions of data.
6. Line Plot - Tracks changes over time.
7. Pie Chart - Represents proportions within a dataset.
8. Scatter Plot - Identifies relationships between variables.
9. Subplots - Combines multiple graphs into one visualization.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Matplotlib

Installation
To run this project, install the necessary library:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

Usage
Run the respective Python scripts to generate each graph:
```bash
python area_chart.py
python bar_plot.py
python box_plot.py
python doughnut_chart.py
python histogram.py
python line_plot.py
python pie_chart.py
python scatter_plot.py
python subplots.py
```

Examples
Each script generates a visualization based on sample data. You can modify the scripts to work with your own datasets.

Contributing
Feel free to contribute by adding new visualization techniques or improving existing ones.
